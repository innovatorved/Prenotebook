      MERN stack is a software stack that includes four open-source
      technologies: (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
      <br />
      <br />
      These components provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web
      sites and web applications. Among these technologies MongoDB is a database
      system,
      <br />
      <br />
      Node.js is a server-side runtime environment, Express.js is a web
      framework for Node.js and React is a client-side JavaScript library used
      for building user interfaces.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Because all components of the MERN stack support programs that are written
      in JavaScript, MERN applications can be written in one programming
      language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.

      Express.js (also referred to as Express) is a modular web application
      framework for Node.js. Whilst Express is capable of acting as an
      internet-facing web server, even supporting SSL/TLS out of the box, it is
      often used in conjunction with a reverse proxy such as NGINX or Apache for
      performance reasons.
